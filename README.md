# MultiThreadApp

Create multi-threaded GUI application allowing users to perform various time-consuming calculations. Use C++ programming language and wxWidgets GUI toolkit for the implementation.

The application must support the following features:

    At least two active worker threads must be allowed at a time
    Activity of the thread/calculation progress must be properly indicated within the application's UI
    The worker threads can be suspended/resumed/deleted by a user
    If needed, slow down the worker thread by using Sleep() function to allow users to interact with the thread

The application should provide:

    Iterative factorial calculation algorithm
    Eratosthene's sieve algorithm
